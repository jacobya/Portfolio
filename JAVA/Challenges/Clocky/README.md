Story<br>
Due to lack of maintenance the minute-hand has fallen off Town Hall clock face.<br>
<br>
And because the local council has lost most of our tax money to a Nigerian email scam there are no funds to fix the clock properly.
<br><br>
Instead, they are asking for volunteer programmers to write some code that tell the time by only looking at the remaining hour-hand!
<br><br>
What a bunch of cheapskates!
<br><br>
Can you do it?
<br><br>
Kata<br>
Given the angle (in degrees) of the hour-hand, return the time in HH:MM format. Round down to the nearest minute.
<br><br>
Examples<br>
12:00 = 0 degrees<br>
03:00 = 90 degrees<br>
06:00 = 180 degrees<br>
09:00 = 270 degrees<br>
12:00 = 360 degrees<br>
Notes<br>
0 <= angle <= 360<br>
